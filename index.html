        Hi I'm Andy, a software engineer with 3+ years of experience. I currently work at Expedia
        Group in Seattle, WA.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had the privilege of building products and tools that benefit travelers, photographers,
        teachers, parents and my unhoused neighbors in Seattle.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy both frontend and backend web development. JavaScript is my go-to, but I've also
        written my fair share of Java, Ruby, Go and SQL. See
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andybangs/">LinkedIn</a> for career details and
        <a href="https://github.com/andybangs">GitHub</a>
        for long-abandoned personal projects.
